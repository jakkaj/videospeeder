# Plan Structure Guidelines

- Plans and architectures that you produce should go under `docs/plans/<new folder for this plan with issue number>`
- If I did not give you a GitHub issue number then you must ask for one then use that in the file name.
- When creating a plan, organize it into numbered phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Setup Dependencies")
- Break down each phase into specific tasks with numeric identifiers (e.g., "Task 1.1: Add Dependencies")
- Please only create one document per plan.
- Include a detailed checklist at the end of the document that maps to all phases and tasks
- Mark tasks as `- [ ]` for pending tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks
- Start all planning tasks as unchecked, and update them to checked as implementation proceeds
- Each planning task should have clear success criteria
- End the plan with success criteria that define when the implementation is complete
